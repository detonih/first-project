# first-project
This is my very first project created when I was on my very first course of JavaScript, but this project is not part of that 
course.
My goal was to training the concepts learned over the basic course of JavaScript. Thereby, I had the idea to create something
that I could do with the simple knowledge what I had just learned.
Thank you for read.
